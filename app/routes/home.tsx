        <p className="mb-4">
          This data is EXTREMELY subjective. Mostly, the number of ascents provided here are nowhere nears the reality.
          These are counted based on the people that have a bleau.info account and that logged their ascent publically.
          That means the numbers are, at best, useful for comparing climbs â€” and, at worst, completely misleading.</p>
        <p>Please, keep a critical eye when browsing the website and don't draw conclusions too fast.</p>
