          Please note that <strong>this data is highly subjective.</strong> The recorded number of ascents can differ significantly 
          from reality, as it only includes ascents logged by users who have a Bleau.info account and have logged their ascents publicly.
          That means the numbers provided are, at best, useful for comparing climbs â€” and, at worst, completely misleading.</p>
        <p>We encourage users to <strong>approach the information critically</strong> and avoid drawing conclusions too fast.</p>
