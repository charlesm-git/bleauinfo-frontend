## Disclaimer

All statistics presented on this website are based on **publicly available data** from Bleau.info

Please note that **this data is highly subjective.** The recorded number of
ascents can differ significantly from reality, as it only includes ascents logged by users
who have a Bleau.info account and have logged their ascents publicly. That means the
numbers provided are, at best, useful for comparing climbs â€” and, at worst, completely
misleading.

We encourage users to **approach the information critically** and avoid
drawing conclusions too fast.
