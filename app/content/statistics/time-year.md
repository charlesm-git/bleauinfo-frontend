**_Climbing activity in Fontainebleau has grown exponentially over the past three decades._**
Starting with a few hundred logged ascents in the mid-90s, the forest saw steady growth through the 2000s. Activity accelerated significantly from 2015 onward, with **2019 marking a major surge, nearly 40% increase in a single year** reflecting both growing popularity and increased platform adoption.

**2021-2023 saw explosive growth**, peaking at over 62,000 logged ascents in 2023. This reflects the post-COVID boom in outdoor climbing and the forest's growing international reputation.

**2020 shows a noticeable dip** due to COVID-19 lockdowns in France during the spring climbing season.

**2024 drops significantly**, most likely explained by exceptionally bad weather during the winter seasonâ€”poor conditions kept climbers away during what are normally high-activity months.

2025 data is incomplete, so final numbers will be higher once the year closes out.


### The forest's popularity is clearly growing fast. We ask everyone to be respectful and help keep Fontainebleau in the best possible shape for future generations.
