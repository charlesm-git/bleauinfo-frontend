_Keep in mind that many boulders don't have style tags, and these are assigned at the discretion of Bleau.info's owner_ (no blaming here, huge respect to Bart for the website maintenance, this is a **BIG** job)

**Walls dominate the forest**, with nearly 12,000 tagged boulders. Sit starts are almost as common, reflecting Fontainebleau's technical start-focused culture.

**Slabs are the third most common style, followed by slightly overhanging boulders and sloper-heavy problems.** This distribution shows Font's reputation for technical vertical and slightly positive climbing.

**Traverses are well-represented**, with directional tags (left-to-right and right-to-left) combining for over 7,000 problemsâ€”a testament to the forest's long boulder walls.

**Steeper terrain is less common.** Full overhangs and roofs appear significantly less than vertical styles, though they still account for several thousand problems.
