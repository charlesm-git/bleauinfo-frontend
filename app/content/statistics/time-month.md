**Seasonal climbing is real. Spring dominates with April hitting peak activity.**
March through May accounts for over 36% of annual ascents, with April alone representing more than 13%. This confirms that spring offers the best conditions for bouldering in Fontainebleau.

**Autumn shows a second favorable window** with September and October combining for nearly 20% of ascents, as temperatures cool down from summer heat.

**The November-December drop is dramatic**, falling to the lowest activity of the year.  
Cold temperatures play a role, but the main culprit is bad weatherâ€”rain and grey skies make these months particularly uninviting for outdoor climbing.

**Summer (June-August) shows moderate but consistent activity**, likely limited by heat on the rocks during peak afternoon hours.
