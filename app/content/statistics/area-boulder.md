**4 areas exceed 800 boulders**

J.A Martin has the most boulders but ranks outside the top 10 for logged ascents.

Generally, areas appearing in the top 10 boulder counts but absent from top 10 ascents contain concentrations of easier grades (<6a). As it can be seen on the grade statistics page, grades below 7a receive fewer logs than harder grades.
