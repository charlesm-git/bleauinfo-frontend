**_6th grades don't make sense_** 
- There is no reason for an under-representation of "+" grades. 
- If you ever thought that "+" grades in the 6th range are poorly graded, well it's probably the case.

**_More consistancy in the 7th and 8th grade but still..._**  
- Even if we can see a better grade repartition in the higher grades, the slope is still not quite as smooth as it should be.  
To smooth it out, we need more "+" grade or less "round" grades. In the current state, that means that "round" grades cover a larger range of difficulty that "+" grades.  
**That means that "round" grades have greater chances to be easy or hard for the grade.**  
I'll let you decide which side you think it has to go.
