**_6th grades show grading inconsistency_**

- There's a **clear under-representation of '+' grades**, especially in the 6th range. There's no climbing-related reason for this pattern, this is just inconsistent grading.
- If you ever thought that "+" grades in the 6th range are poorly graded, well it's probably the case.

**_7th and 8th grades improve but remain uneven._**

- Higher grades show more balanced distribution, but the slope isn't as smooth as it should be. 'round' grades (6a, 6b, 7a) are overrepresented compared to '+' grades, which means **round grades cover a wider difficulty range**.
