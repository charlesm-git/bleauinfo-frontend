**_The "I don't log under 7a" phenomenon_**

Grades below 7a receive noticeably fewer logs relative to harder grades. This could be explained by several factors (these are hypotheses):
- Experienced climbers selectively log their harder sends
- Beginners are less likely to use logging platforms
- Social dynamicsâ€”people prefer showcasing difficulty over volume

**_7b+ and 7c+ drop off_**

These grades are noticeably less climbed. One likely explanation is that climbers at this level chase the next 'round' grade milestone (7c and 8a) rather than spending time in these intermediate grades.
