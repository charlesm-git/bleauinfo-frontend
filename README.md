# Bleau.Info Statistics — Frontend

This is the frontend application for a data analysis project built on top of the **Bleau.Info** website. It provides climbers with extended and visually rich statistics not available on the original site.

## 🧭 Project Overview

**Bleau.Info Statistics** offers a new way to explore climbing data from Fontainebleau. Using data extracted from Bleau.Info, this frontend delivers meaningful insights and visualizations for climbers who want to:

- Discover the **most popular boulders** in the forest
- See **trends by grade, year, or location**
- Track **ascents by user, area, or time period**
- Visualize climbing activity through **interactive charts and graphs**

All statistics are generated by a custom backend (FastAPI), and this frontend consumes the API to render clean, usable, and informative views.

## 🎯 Purpose

While Bleau.Info is a valuable resource for climbers, its default interface is limited in terms of statistical exploration. This project was designed to:

- Make hidden trends and patterns visible
- Support training, goal setting, and historical research
- Provide a better UX for analyzing personal or global ascent history

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **React** (Vite)
- **Recharts** (Data visualization)
- **React Router** (Routing/navigation)
- **FastAPI** (backend API)
- **Custom API integration** for real-time data
